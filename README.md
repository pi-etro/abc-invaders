## About

ABC Invaders is a 2D game developed with the [ABCg](https://github.com/hbatagelo/abcg) framework.

ABC Invaders is a [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) clone implemented with C++ programming language and OpenGL. This project was developed by us for the Computer Graphics course at UFABC. This 2D game is a simplified version of the original Space Invaders developed in 1978. The player is represented by a laser cannon able to move horizontally on the screen, with the objective to shoot all the aliens, that can also shoot the player (and then the game is over). The aliens move both horizontally and vertically, constantly approching the laser cannon.

The main libraries used by ABCg ABCg are: [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to handle inputs and outputs, [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) to access the OpenGL graphical API and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to generate the application's WebAssembly.
